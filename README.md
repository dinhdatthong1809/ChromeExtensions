My personal tools

## 1 - fpt-poly-lms-online-lecture-auto-cheater
It will automatically choose the correct answer for "online lectures' questions" of my school (FPT Polytechnic).

Developed in 2nd year, I found out the correct answer was checked on client side

## 2 - fpt-poly-quiz-exam-data-crawler
This tool massively crawls data from "online quizzes" of various lessons of my school (FPT Polytechnic).

Data includes multiple-choice questions and their correct answer.

Developed in 2nd year, I exploited a security hole of my school's web-site, which related to "Insecure Direct Object References"

## 3 - gpx-plus-tricker
Tool for a "mass-clicking game".
Developed feature like:
- auto interact
- manipulate data and override some scripts of the game
- adaptive UI based on different context
